							Since Freya has already introduced this tool in her last group seminar, I just make a quick summary<br>
							taXaminer will have the assembly data as the main input and take into account many characters to cluster the similar genes together,
							such as the read coverage, the GC content, the gene length, the gene position on the contigs, etc.<br>
							It uses the Principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimention of those characters into 2 or 3 dimentions

							Then, from the cluster result of taXaminer, we can then inspect the taxonomic assignment of each gene and classify them as contamination or native genes<br>
							For example here in this small cloud, we see many Ascomycota hits.
							They are all belong to short scaffolds and have low read coverage in compare to the others.
							Therefore, one could consider them as candidates for contamination.<br>

							Another question we can ask: Is my gene set complete? This can be answered with the most well-known tool BUSCO.

						<aside class="notes">
							The starting point of fCAT is the core set for each taxonomic clade
							(eukaryota, metazoa, sarcopterygii, actinopterygii, lecanoromyces, alveolata).
							fCAT core sets are currently created by using OMA ortholog groups,
							but they can be replaced by any other ortholog groups like from OrthoMCL, OrthoDB, HieranoiDB,...<br>
							fCAT will search ortholog for these core groups in the species of interest using a targeted search algorithm,<br>
							then classify the founded orthologs as complete or fragmented based on the sequence length,
							or as similar or dissimilar based on the protein domain architectures

						<aside class="notes">
							Different than BUSCO, which can only assign a gene as complete or fragmented, fCAT delivers more information<br>
							Such as in this example, we found an "fragmented" ortholog in the species of interest, the Trachinus draco species.
							It lacks the BTB and BACK domains in the N-terminus im comparison to the orthologs of other species.
							By looking at the assembly, we found a direct upstream gene, which has exactly these 2 missing domains.
							So, this could be a fission event that happened in Trachinus draco which split the original gene into 2 parts.

						<aside class="notes">
							I hope that you still remember the workflow of fDOG from my last group seminar.<br>
							Starting with a seed protein (the FAD or ELOVL from the previous slide),
							fDOG iteratively search for orthologs in a set of so-called core taxa. After each round,
							new ortholog will be added to the core ortholog group to create a profile HMM for the core group.
							When the core group reach to a pre-defined number of orthologs, this core compilation step will stop and the final pHMM will be created.<br>
							Then, fDOG use this pHMM to search for similar sequences in the species of interest.
							The candidate HMM hits will then be checked, if it passes the reciprocal criterium, it will be considered as an ortholog
							and will be added to the final ortholog group.<br>
							Finally, fDOG create a phylogenetic profiles for the seed protein with the founded orthologs in different taxa

						<aside class="notes">
							The main purpose of the phylogenetic profiles from fDOG is not different than showing the presence/absence pattern of the seed proteins in a list of diverse species<br>
							The only different from the original phylogenetic profiles is,

						<p>Domain (feature) architecture comparison</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							However, the most relevant feature is still the comparison of the protein domain architecture.<br>
							With this, we can easily find genes that have changes in their architectures, which suggest also for
							functional changes. Or, we can figure out, if the difference in the domain architecture is just
							a technical artifact due to wrong gene prediction.<br>
							For example here is the domain plot of a human protein agains 2 orthologous proteins from 2 different Chimpanzee gene sets.
							We see the ortholog in the QfO gene set is much shorter than the one in the NCBI Refseq gene set.
							It is missing the whole path in the N-terminus. So, our hypothesis is a wrong gene prediction happened in the QfO dataset.<br>
							<em>(The possibility for a gene fission event here is rather low. Because, human and chimp are very close relative.
							If the fission event happened in Chimp, we should also see that in human.
							And if it is the case, then we had 2 independent wrong gene prediction in human gene set and in the chimpanzee refseq gene sets.
							Which is quite hard to believe)</em>

							FAS score has a value between 1 and 0; 1: completely similar; 0: completely different or no annotated domain found.<br>
							Given 2 proteins, greedyFAS will annotate them with different features such as PFAM/SMART domains, transmembrane domains, low complexity regions,...
							Then, the tool compares the 2 annotated architectures and penalize the missing features, depending on which protein is considered as the reference protein.<br>
							For example here, if we take A as the reference and compare with B, the Pleckstrin domain is missing, therefore the FAS score in this direction is only 0.6<br>
							But, in the reverse direction, all the domains of B can be found in A, which will lead to a maximum FAS score of 1.

							As a summary, here I show you the relationship between our tools.<br>
							The grey arrows shows the input and output flow between the tools;
							the blue arrows shows the integration of one tool in the others.<br>
							As we can see here, most of the tools are written in Python and are available
							as python packages, which means one can install them using pip command.<br>
							For the graphical user interface tools, we have different approaches,
							from JavaScript for MATT, to React for G-NOM and R-Shiny for PhyloProfile.<br>
							Beside the ability to install the tools from PyPi or Bioconductor,
							you can get the source code of those tools (except G-NOM) on the BIONF github repository
